Don’t fall into the trap of hiring a plumbing company that is able to offer a cheaper price because they operate without a license, don’t obtain the required permits, or carry adequate insurance.

Compliance with codes and adequate insurance is important to you for liability reasons. If a worker is injured and the contractor is not insured, you can be held liable. Or, if there is an insurance claim due to a fire or an accident that is related to unlicensed work or work for which no permit was obtained, your insurance company may dispute the claim. You also want to avoid questions related to workmanship when you sell the house, which may end up costing you more than the original repair to correct.
