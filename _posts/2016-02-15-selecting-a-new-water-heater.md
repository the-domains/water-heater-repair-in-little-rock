# Selecting a New Water Heater

You have a lot to consider when selecting a new water heater for your home. You should choose a water heating system that will not only provide enough hot water but also that will do so energy efficiently, saving you money. This includes considering the different types of water heaters available and determining the right size and fuel source for your home.

##### Types of Water Heaters

It's a good idea to know the different types of water heaters available before you purchase one:

* [**Conventional storage water heaters**][0]Offer a ready reservoir (storage tank) of hot water
* [**Demand (tankless or instantaneous) water heaters**][1]Heat water directly without the use of a storage tank
* [**Heat pump water heaters**][2]Move heat from one place to another instead of generating heat directly for providing hot water
* [**Solar water heaters**][3]Use the sun's heat to provide hot water
* [**Tankless coil and indirect water heaters**][4]Use a home's space heating system to heat water
