# Why
You Should Have Your Water Heater Professionally Installed

1. **You
may not select the right water heater for your needs and
specifications.**It's
not as simple as replacing a 40-gallon hot water heater with another 40-gallon model. Due to the new energy efficiency ratings certain water heaters have either increased in size, lower Btu input rating or increase in dimension. Fuel source, energy efficiency, fast recovery, venting and
anticipated demand must all be considered in order to determine the
correct model.
2. **Local
codes and ordinances may not permit self-installation.**Regulations
governing water heater installation vary by city. Professional
contractors are familiar with the rules and regulations in each city
they service. Arkansas requires ALL water heater installation/replacement to be permitted and inspected buy the local plumbing inspector.
3. **Installation
requires materials and knowledge most homeowners don't have on
hand.**Installation
involves much more than just attaching a water line. A professional
contractor arrives with all the fittings, pipes, parts, tools,
venting materials and valves needed to install the job correctly the
first time. Most also include removal and disposal of your old
water.
4. **A
professional contractor may be able to repair your hot water heater
instead of replace it.**If
your hot water heater's problem is diagnosed as a defective heating
element or faulty valve, it can be fixed. A contractor's experience
is the difference between a minor repair and unnecessary investment
in a new water heater.
5. **Contractors
provide safety and security you can live with.**Professional
contractors are licensed and bonded to ensure your safety. Most
provide warranties covering each installation. The local building
authorities inspect all work, as required by code to protect your
family's health and safety.
