Rinnai Tankless water heater installation and repair by Associated Plumbers 501-666-9483 Little Rock, North Little Rock, Sherwood, Maumelle, Mabelvale

**Rinnai
Continuum provides never-ending hot water to households 24 hours a
day at the rate of up to 9.8 gallons per minute.**

This unique feature allows homeowners the luxury of using multiple
hot water sources at once without any loss of temperature
consistency. Because Rinnai Continuum is not limited by capacity, as
are typical 50 and 75 gallon tanks, today's 70+ gallon bathtubs can
be filled again and again without penalizing the other hot water
needs in the home. 

**Homes
with a Rinnai Continuum can run a washing machine, dishwasher and
shower simultaneously without worrying about hot water running out at
any source.**

Rinnai
Continuum is up to 50 percent more energy efficient than a
traditional natural gas water heater and
up to 70 percent more efficient than an electric water heater.
Whereas 40-gallon tanks require 16 sq. ft. of floor space and usually
last around 10 years, Rinnai Continuum is a compact wall mounted unit
with a life expectancy of 25 years. Because the Continuum does not
require a tank, the risk of tank-type water heater ruptures is
eliminated. Rinnai Continuum can be set to operate at exact
user-specifiable temperatures via the digital and easy-to-use control
pad placed in multiple locations of a home. This is an extremely
important feature in households with small children and elderly
individuals to help prevent scalding accidents. Rinnai Continuum also
offers flexibility in its wall-mounted locations. Should the user
prefer to mount the unit indoors, it safely uses no indoor make-up
air and vents directly to the atmosphere. However, a unique advantage
of Rinnai Continuum is its ability to be mounted on the exterior of a
house, completely removing a combustible device from the home and
freeing up valuable floor-space. Additionally, the unit can be
mounted in a recessed box, flush-mounted and painted or textured to
match the external fa√ßade.

Unlike
antiquated water tanks that constantly store and reheat water, the
Rinnai shuts off automatically when the water source tap is closed,
providing its users with significant energy cost savings. Whereas
40-gallon tanks require 16 sq. ft. of floor space and usually last
