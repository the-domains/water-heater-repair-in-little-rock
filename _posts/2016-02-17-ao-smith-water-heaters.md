A.O. Smith as one of the worlds largest water heater manufacturer
offers the solutions to any water heating need you may encounter.
They offer an extensive line of residential and commercial water
heaters. 

The
residential, gas-powered, conventionally vented water heater stands
as the time-tested workhorse of our industry. Unlimited flows rates
and large standby supplies of hot water have helped make this design
the most popular style across a diverse geographic area. Whether
powered by natural or propane (LP) gas, this venerable and familiar
style has undergone considerable change in recent history. The most
important change was the incorporation of Flammable Vapor Ignition
Resistant (FVIR) technology.
