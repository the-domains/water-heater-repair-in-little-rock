# Repiping Water Systems Contractor for the Little Rock Metro Area

If your Little Rock Metro home has galvanized piping and is over 40 years old, or if you notice when you flush a toilet or turn the water on, that the water pressure drops in another part of the house or water temperature fluctuates (i.e. sudden bursts of hot or cold water in the shower), you may be need to have your water pipes replaced.

Typically, houses are repiped with copper or Pex piping. Associated Plumbers, Inc. can do Pex ( a form of plastic) repiping but in our professional opinion, Copper is a better product.  
Copper piping. We have done many repipes with this method and feel that it truly is the best, and in the long run the most cost effective way of repiping your water system. 

Wirsbo AQUAPEX piping encourages better water flow, is quieter (virtually eliminating the sound of water running in the ceiling or floor when a faucet or shower is turned on) and helps reduce the metallic taste in water and makes it clean, safe and toxin free. It is more affordable to install as it can be installed faster and easier than traditional copper plumbing, is leak proof and is safe, as it can be installed without the fire hazards created by soldering guns and torches.
