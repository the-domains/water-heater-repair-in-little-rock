# Setting
the Temperature on your Water Heater 

# Hot Water Scalds: Safety Alert

The
majority of injuries and deaths involving tap water scalds are to the
elderly and children under the age of five. The U.S. Consumer Product
Safety Commission (CPSC) urges all users to lower their water heaters
to 120 degrees Fahrenheit. In addition to preventing accidents, this
decrease in temperature will conserve energy and save money.

Most
adults will suffer third-degree burns if exposed to 150 degree water
for two seconds. Burns will also occur with a six-second exposure to
140 degree water or with a thirty second exposure to 130 degree
water. Even if the temperature is 120 degrees, a five minute exposure
could result in third-degree burns. Various procedures for lowering
water temperature in the home exist, depending on the method of
heating. Here are some suggestions:

CPSC
notes that a thermostat setting of 120 degrees Fahrenheit (49 degrees
Celsius) may be necessary for residential water heaters to reduce or
eliminate the risk of most tap water scald injuries. Consumers should
consider lowering the thermostat to the lowest settings that will
satisfy hot water needs for all clothing and dish washing machines.

Never
take hot water temperature for granted. Always hand-test before
using, especially when bathing infants and young children. Leaving a
child unsupervised in the bathroom, even if only for a second, could
cause serious injuries. Your presence at all times is the best
defense against accidents and scalding to infants and young children.

## Don't Get Burned!...An Anti-Scald Device Will Protect Your Family

In homes where there is a high demand for hot water, homeowners often turn up the temperature on their hot water heaters to meet this need, sometimes well beyond the 120 degree Fahrenheit factory setting considered safe. Temperatures higher than this can cause severe scalding. At highest risk are children and elderly or disabled persons.

In such situations, installing an anti-scald device is an affordable way to protect against this risk.

## Scalding Facts

* Hot water scalds account for 20% of all burns
* More than 2,000 American children are treated for scalds each year
* Scalding accidents occur most frequently in the bathrooms and kitchens where they are most preventable
* Scalding leads to additional injuries such as heart attacks, shock, falls, and serious broken bones, particularly among the elderly
* Scalding and other burns require the most expensive treatments: long hospital stays, costly skin grafts, and plastic surgery
* Most U.S. states now mandate some form of anti-scald measures in building codes

## Hot Water Re-Circulation Systems  

## _...When You Need a Lot of Hot Water Fast_

If you demand a lot of hot water with minimal waiting on your hot water heater, a hot water recirculation system may be the solution for you. The system consists of a small pump mounted near the bottom of your water heater along with a swing check valve and return line from your farthest fixture. The cost of operating such a system can be minimized using new energy efficient pumps and incorporating a timer and/or thermostat to program the system to turn off when it detects ample hot water or during times of day when the demand for hot water is reduced.

## Shower Without Fear of Hot Water Spikes

Nothing disrupts a relaxing shower like a rush of scalding water when someone flushes a toilet. This causes changes in your pressure in the water line supplying your shower, and when you have changes in pressure on one side and not the other, you will feel the result of different volumes of hot versus cold water. Fortunately, this common problem is easily solved by installing a pressure balance device on the hot and cold water that feeds the shower faucet to detect changes in pressure and automatically balance it. Alternatively, you can have the shower faucet replaced with a pressure balance faucet. Want to shower without fear? We'll be happy to help.
