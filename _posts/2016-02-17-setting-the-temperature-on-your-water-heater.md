# Setting
the Temperature on your Water Heater 

# Hot Water Scalds: Safety Alert

The
majority of injuries and deaths involving tap water scalds are to the
elderly and children under the age of five. The U.S. Consumer Product
Safety Commission (CPSC) urges all users to lower their water heaters
to 120 degrees Fahrenheit. In addition to preventing accidents, this
decrease in temperature will conserve energy and save money.

Most
adults will suffer third-degree burns if exposed to 150 degree water
for two seconds. Burns will also occur with a six-second exposure to
140 degree water or with a thirty second exposure to 130 degree
water. Even if the temperature is 120 degrees, a five minute exposure
could result in third-degree burns. Various procedures for lowering
water temperature in the home exist, depending on the method of
heating. Here are some suggestions:

**Electric
water heaters**

.
Call your local electric company to adjust the thermostat. Some
companies offer this service at no-charge. Hot water should not be
used for at least two hours prior to setting. To make the adjustment
yourself, start by shutting off current to the water heater, then
turn off the circuit breaker to the heater or remove the fuse that
serves the heater. Most electric water heaters have two thermostats,
both of which must be set to a common temperature for proper
operation. To reach these thermostats you must remove the upper and
lower access panels. Adjust the thermostat following the instructions
provided with the appliance. Hold a candy or meat thermometer under
the faucet to check water temperature.

**Gas
water heaters**

.
Because thermostats differ, call your local gas company for
instructions. Where precise temperatures are not given, hold a candy
or meat thermometer under faucet for most accurate reading first
thing in the morning or at least two hours after water use. If
reading is too high, adjust thermostat on heater, according to
manufacturer's instructions, and check again with thermometer.

If you live in an apartment, contact
the building manager to discuss possible options for lowering your
tap water temperature. 

CPSC
notes that a thermostat setting of 120 degrees Fahrenheit (49 degrees
Celsius) may be necessary for residential water heaters to reduce or
eliminate the risk of most tap water scald injuries. Consumers should
consider lowering the thermostat to the lowest settings that will
satisfy hot water needs for all clothing and dish washing machines.

Never
take hot water temperature for granted. Always hand-test before
using, especially when bathing infants and young children. Leaving a
child unsupervised in the bathroom, even if only for a second, could
cause serious injuries. Your presence at all times is the best
defense against accidents and scalding to infants and young children.
