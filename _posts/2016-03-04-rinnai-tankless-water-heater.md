# Rinnai Tankless Water Heaters 

Rinnai Continuum provides never-ending hot water to households 24 hours a day at the rate of up to 9.8 gallons per minute.
This unique feature allows homeowners the luxury of using multiple hot water sources at once without any loss of temperature consistency. 

Because Rinnai Continuum is not limited by capacity, as are typical 50 and 75 gallon tanks, today's 70+ gallon bathtubs can be filled again and again without penalizing the other hot water needs in the home.
Homes with a Rinnai Continuum can run a washing machine, dishwasher and shower simultaneously without worrying about hot water running out at any source. 

Rinnai Continuum is up to 50 percent more energy efficient than a traditional natural gas water heater and up to 70 percent more efficient than an electric water heater. Whereas 40-gallon tanks require 16 sq. ft. of floor space and usually last around 10 years, Rinnai Continuum is a compact wall mounted unit with a life expectancy of 25 years. Because the Continuum does not require a tank, the risk of tank-type water heater ruptures is eliminated. 

Rinnai Continuum can be set to operate at exact user-specifiable temperatures via the digital and easy-to-use control pad placed in multiple locations of a home. This is an extremely important feature in households with small children and elderly individuals to help prevent scalding accidents. Rinnai Continuum also offers flexibility in its wall-mounted locations. Should the user prefer to mount the unit indoors, it safely uses no indoor make-up air and vents directly to the atmosphere. However, a unique advantage of Rinnai Continuum is its ability to be mounted on the exterior of a house, completely removing a combustible device from the home and freeing up valuable floor-space. Additionally, the unit can be mounted in a recessed box, flush-mounted and painted or textured to match the external fa√ßade. 

Unlike antiquated water tanks that constantly store and reheat water, the Rinnai shuts off automatically when the water source tap is closed, providing its users with significant energy cost savings.
